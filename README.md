# DWIN Font Files
This repo contains my experimental codes for encoding and decoding .HZK Font files used on DWIN displays. I have based my code largely on those at https://github.com/enigmaquip/T5UIC1_Font
## Warning
The resulting .HZK font files generated by the encoding code have not been tested yet. Do NOT upload them to your DWIN display without knowing the risks. If something goes wrong it might not be possible to restore the old font.
## Instruction
Instructions on how to use are inside each folder.
