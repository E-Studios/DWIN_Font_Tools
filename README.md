# DWIN Font Files
This repo contains my experimental codes for encoding and decoding .HZK Font files used on DWIN displays.
## Warning!
These codes have not been tested yet. Do NOT upload them to your DWIN display without knowing the risks. If something goes wrong it might not be possible to restore the old font.
