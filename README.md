# DWIN Font Files
This repo contains my codes for encoding and decoding .HZK Font files used on DWIN displays. I have based my code largely on those at https://github.com/enigmaquip/T5UIC1_Font

## Instruction
Instructions on how to encode, decode, upload and create .HZK Font files can be found inside each folder.

## Revert to the original font
You can revert back to the original font simply by uploading the file from `HZK Font Files/DWIN Font (original)/` to your display.
