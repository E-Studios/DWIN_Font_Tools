# DWIN Font Tools
This repo contains my codes for encoding and decoding .HZK Font files used on the Creality Ender 3 V2 DWIN displays.

## Instruction
Instructions on how to encode, decode, upload and create .HZK Font files can be found inside each folder.

## Dowloading the fonts
You can download the most recent version of the fonts form the release tab.

## Revert to the original font
You can revert back to the original font simply by uploading the file from `HZK Font Files/DWIN Font (original)/` to your display.
