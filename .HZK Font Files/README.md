# Uploading a Font File
To upload a font file to your display:
- Place the file inside a folder named `DWIN_SET`.
- Remove the back cover of the display and insert the card into the microSD slot on the back of the display.
- Power on the machine and wait for the screen to change from blue to orange.
- Power off the machine.
- Remove the SD card from the back of the display.
- Power on to confirm a successful flash.

## Troubleshooting
If flashing is not working (e.g. the blue screen only flashes for a second before the orange screen):
- Reformat the SD card in FAT32 with 4k allocations
